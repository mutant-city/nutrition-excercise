  Instructions:
    Main:
      1: Heat oven to 400°F | 200°C.
      2: On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss together potatoes with the oil, 1/2 tablespoon of garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
      3: Spread out in an even layer and roast for 15 minutes until they're just starting to soften and brown.
      4: Push potatoes to one side of the sheet pan and arrange salmon down the centre.
      5: Rub salmon evenly with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the minced garlic and 2 tablespoons of parsley.
      6: Add the asparagus to the other side of the pan.
      7: Combine 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of the melted butter together and pour the mixture over the salmon and asparagus.
      8: Season everything with the remaining salt and pepper.
      9: Return to oven and continue baking until the potatoes are golden and fork-tender and the salmon is opaque throughout, (about 10 minutes).
      10: Optional, broil in the last 2 minutes for charred edges.
      11: Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the remaining butter, garlic and lemon juice with the wine (or chicken stock).
      12: Serve with the salmon, veggies and lemon slices!
